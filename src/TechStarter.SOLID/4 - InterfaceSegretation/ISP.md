# Each interface should have a specific purpose. 
# You shouldn’t be forced to implement an interface when your object doesn’t share that purpose. 
# By extrapolation, the larger the interface, the more likely it includes methods that not all implementers can achieve. 
# That’s the essence of the Interface Segregation Principle.
